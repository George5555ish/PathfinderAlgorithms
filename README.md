## Project Motivation
This project was inspired by an interest to test the performance capabilities of the React framework. It is a pathfinder algorithm visualizer using the Djikstra and A-Star algorithms to calculate the shortest distance between two points. Ideally, the euclidean distance was considered for this project as its computation for a given node would not be too resource heavy for a single distance. This can be improved on by changing the distance parameters to a more complex system.
